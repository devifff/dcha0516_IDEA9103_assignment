This repo is for my final assignment of Creative Coding


# COMMIT 1

The first commit modifies the group code to make the circles in the figure move around when the song "RUDE-Eternal Youth" plays which is a Free to use, Royalty free music which has a *Creative Commons License* and allows to be used for a Non Commercial use


## HOW IT WORKS


Upon pressing the SpaceBar the song plays and the animation begins where the celestial bodies are created randomly, the grass cylinders move up and down and the river circles start moving up while the tree swings from left to right.


## THE CHANGES


In order to get this effect I made a few changes in the group's original code to suit my choice, hardcoding a few elements while making others dynamic and removing a loop and also relying on switch case statements to make the shapes move when song plays and stop when the song stops

## THOUGHTS

This artwork reminds me of Feudal Japan and the tree looks like a cherry blossom and this was the reason behind choosing this music. The key press functionality lacks the user interface and the user wouldn't exactly know how to interact with the artwork unless they read the code first and that is something I plan to work on in the next commit.





# COMMIT 2

In this commit I haven't changed a lot apart from adding the playmusic button and getting rid of the press spacebar function to play the music to make the design more user friendly.

# **Future Changes**

I will try to play around the code a little more and see what I can achieve, I dont want to change the music as it fits the scene.
